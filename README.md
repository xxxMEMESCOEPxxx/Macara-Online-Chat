# Macara-Online-Chat
Macara Online Chat is a chat service that you can use to talk with friends and family across the internet! Just have them set up a server, 
port forward using Hamachi (you can find it here: https://www.vpn.net/), send you the IP Address that Hamachi gives you, and chat away! 

Here is a great tutorial on how to set up Hamachi:
